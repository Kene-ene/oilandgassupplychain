# oilandgassupplychain
Oil and Gas supply chain profit optimization model to counter negative oil prices during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Manufacturing companies are implementing strategies to make calculated risks, in line with the
COVID-19 pandemic trend, in order to ensure continued profits. These companies are
particularly seeking technology that will provide greater operational visibility into their supply
chains. That way, they can predict which goods and materials are in the supply chain, where
they are in the chain and when their need will become urgent. Such Value of Information (VOI)
is priceless in times like this. Manufacturers will be able to predict market prices and estimate
how much to spend on raw materials and how much to produce, at any given instant in time.

This repository proposes design additions for a robust Control system based on fundamental Chemical
Engineering principles of Process Control and Dynamics, to engineer visibility into outbound
goods as they are manufactured, assembled and shipped to customers through the
transportation network.
